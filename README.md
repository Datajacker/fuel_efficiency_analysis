# fuel_efficiency_analysis
The repository concerns the fuel efficiency analysis of different vehicles from different manufacturers based on the data from the Depart of Energy, US.
* One post about this project has been shared on [medium](https://jyi3.medium.com/how-to-conduct-data-science-based-on-the-business-context-239cf934cee8)
* The recording of the presentation has been posted on [YouTube](youtube.com/watch?v=kHunTjkJPow&feature=youtu.be)
* The steps of the data science process: **gather, assess, clean, analyze, model, visualize**
* This project employs the **CRISP-DM** process.

## Installation

This project analyzes the dataset and builds the model to predict the mpg. 

A few libraries need to be imported:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project motivation

This project explores how the features of vehicles impact their fuel efficiency. The data is directly taken from the Department of Energy, US Government. Their fuel efficiency is evaluated by their mile per gallon (MPG) under different conditions. It could be potentially used in the design of vehicles and the implementation of environmental standards.

## File description
The detailed dataset and description of features can be accessed [here](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#vehicle).
