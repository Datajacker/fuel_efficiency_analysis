# fuel_efficiency_analysis
The repository concerns the fuel efficiency analysis of different vehicles from different manufacturers based on the data from the Depart of Energy, US.

## Installation

This project analyzes the dataset and builds the model to predict the mpg. 

A few libraries need to be imported:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project motivation

This project explores how the features of vehicles impact their fuel efficiency. The data is directly taken from the Department of Energy, US Government. Their fuel efficiency is evaluated by their mile per gallon (MPG) under different conditions.

## File description
The detailed dataset and description of features can be accessed [here](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#vehicle).
